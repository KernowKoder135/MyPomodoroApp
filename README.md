My first attempt at writing Python software. 
A simple Pomodoro Timer.

### TODO ###
- Separate things into different tabs, so there is a settings tab.
- Have some way of saving completed pomodoros in a dictionary.
- Have a way to plot that information or display it in a visually pleasing way.
- Save that data somewhere permenantly, so that it can be accessed each time the application is started.
- Need to have some kind of "user" setting ... who is using the Pomodoro Timer currently?
- Programable breaks ... long and short ... every x pomodoros for y/z minutes respectively.
- Some kind of finishing popup, sound or message.
